# Hello, I'm Alessandro 👋

I'm an italian student currently at ETH Zürich for my master's deegree. I'm passionate about 

## 🎓Education
- Bachelor's degree in Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano
- Master's degree in Computational Science and Engineering at ETH Zürich

## 📚 Some cool projects

1. [[`Pricing of derivatives using the Heston Model`](https://github.com/i-Alessandro/Implementation-and-Calibration-of-the-Heston-Model)]*: This repository contains a Python implementation of the Heston Model, and an example of its calibration using data from the S&P 500 ETF. The model is based on the Carr-Madan pricing method using the Fourier Transform.
2. [[`Portfolio Costruction with mixed Integer Programming`](https://github.com/i-Alessandro/Mixed-Integer-Programming-for-Portfolio-Construction)]*: Code for the Python (with Gurobi solver) implementation of the MIP model presented in the paper: "Portfolio Construction Through Mixed-Integer Programming at Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo and Company".
