# Hello, I'm Alessandro 👋

I'm an italian student currently at ETH Zürich for my master's deegree.

## 🎓Education
- Bachelor's degree in Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano
- Master's degree in Computational Science and Engineering at ETH Zürich

## 📚 Some cool projects

1. [`Dropout Prediction for Mathematical Engineering Students`](https://github.com/i-Alessandro/Progetto-Inferenza-Statistica/tree/main): In this project for the course *Inferential Statistics* we developed a logistic regression model to predict which features indicate a chance of dropout for the students in the bachelor's degree in  mathematical engineering from Politecnico di Milano.
2. [`Pricing of derivatives using the Heston Model`](https://github.com/i-Alessandro/Implementation-and-Calibration-of-the-Heston-Model): This project is a Python implementation of the Heston Model, and an example of its calibration using data from the S&P 500 ETF. The model is based on the Carr-Madan pricing method using the Fourier Transform.
3. [`Portfolio Costruction with mixed Integer Programming`](https://github.com/i-Alessandro/Mixed-Integer-Programming-for-Portfolio-Construction): Code for the Python (with Gurobi solver) implementation of the MIP model presented in the paper: "Portfolio Construction Through Mixed-Integer Programming at Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo and Company".
